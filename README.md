This project integrates a user-friendly interface built with Flask and various advanced functionalities to interact with a chatbot (powered by Dialogflow API), ingest data from various sources, process and store the data, run AI models, and provide reporting and notification capabilities.

Features
User Interface: 
Implemented using Flask, rendering an HTML template for user interaction.

Chatbot Interface: 
Integrated with Dialogflow API for handling user queries.

Data Ingestion Layer:
Provides an API endpoint to collect data from multiple sources.

Data Processing and Storage:
Contains functions to process and store collected data effectively.

AI Models:
Example forecasting function using OpenAI's API.

Integration Layer:
Provides an API endpoint for integration with external systems.

Reporting and Notification System:
Functions to generate various reports and send notifications to users.
