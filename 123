example for a simple static site:```toml[build]
   publish = "public"
   command = "npm run build"

    [build.environment]
      NODE_VERSION = "14"

    [dev]
      command = "npm run dev"
      port = 8888
      targetPort = 3000
    ``
### Step 3: Connect Your Repository to Netlify
1. **Go to the Netlify Dashboard** and click on “New site from Git.”
2. **Select your Git provider** (e.g., GitHub) and authorize Netlify to access your account.
3. **Select the repository** you created for your project.
4. **Configure your settings**: In the deployment settings, set the build command (if applicable, e.g., npm run build for a React app) and the publish directory (e.g., public, dist`).
